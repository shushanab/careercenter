This is a careercenter site's fresh look. It includes the following parts:

1. Scraper in `Node.js` to collect data from [careercenter.am](http://careercenter.am) and store is as a `JSON` document.
2. **SPA** with `Vue.js` to display the scraped data. The **SPA** allows user to filter job listings by company name, job position.
