Your **task** should you choose to accept it is the following:

1. Build a scraper in `Node.js` to collect data from [careercenter.am](http://careercenter.am) and store is as a `JSON` document.
2. Develop an **SPA** with `Vue.js` to display the scraped data. The **SPA** should allow a user to filter job listings.
